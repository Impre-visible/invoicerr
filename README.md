## üê≥ Docker Installation (Recommended)

#### Supported Architectures

The images are built for the following architectures:

- `linux/amd64` (x86_64)
- `linux/arm64/v8` (ARMv8)

#### Why not `linux/arm/v7`?

The `linux/arm/v7` architecture is not supported due to the use of prisma, which does not provide prebuilt binaries for this architecture. This means that the application will not run on 32-bit ARM devices.

The fastest way to run Invoicerr is using Docker Compose. A prebuilt image is available at [ghcr.io/impre-visible/invoicerr](https://ghcr.io/impre-visible/invoicerr).

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Impre-visible/invoicerr.git
   cd invoicerr
   ```

2. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` to set your environment variables.

3. Run the app:  
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open your browser at:  
   ```
   http://localhost
   ```

### üîß Environment Variables

These environment variables are defined in `docker-compose.yml` under the `invoicerr` service:

- `DATABASE_URL`  
  PostgreSQL connection string. Example:  
  `postgresql://invoicerr:invoicerr@invoicerr_db:5432/invoicerr_db`

- `APP_URL`  
  Full public URL of the frontend (e.g., `https://invoicerr.example.com`).  
  This is required for email templates and links.

- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`  
  Credentials and server used for sending emails (quotes, invoices, etc.)

- `SMTP_FROM`  
  Optional ‚Äî address used as the sender for emails. If omitted, defaults to `SMTP_USER`.

- `JWT_SECRET`  
  Optional but recommended for JWT authentication. Can be any random string.  
  If not set, a default secret will be used. But it can have issues with docker deployments.

Make sure port 80 is available on your host machine, or change the mapping.
